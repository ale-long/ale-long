### About Me

Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Alex, a first-generation college student, and a sophomore studying computer science at UC Davis with interests in web development and software engineering. My passion lies in social good and leveraging technology to create an impact. Currently, I am a technical director at HackDavis, a hackathon focused on spearheading social good initiatives, in which I have developed the landing page site in a team of 4 using various technologies like React.js, Gatsby.js, and Firebase. 

I am always seeking opportunities to improve myself and further my knowledge in any way I can. My ability to accept and learn from constructive criticism has allowed me to thrive in a constantly changing environment, and I look forward to bringing that mentality into my future endeavors.
