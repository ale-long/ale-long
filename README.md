### About Me

Hi, nice to meet you! My name is Alex, a first-generation college student, and a sophomore studying computer science at UC Davis with interests in web development and software engineering. My passion lies in social good and leveraging technology to create an impact. Currently, I am a technical director at HackDavis, a hackathon focused on spearheading social good initiatives, in which I have developed the landing page site in a team of 4 using various technologies like **React.js**,**Gatsby.js**, and **Firebase**. 


In order to further develop my passion for web development and social good, I am also currently developing **Sub.ly**, a full-stack web app that streamlines the apartment sub-leasing process for college students. My friends and I drew inspiration from the housing group pages on Facebook and realized how inefficient they can be as students are posting on top of each other. Information is easily lost and it can be a hassle for students to scroll through a plethora of posts in order to find the right apartment for them. Our goal is to make this process hassle-free and time-efficient so students can focus on more important matters at hand. Our tech stack consists of **React.js**, **Firebase** (authentication), **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **Node.js**, and **GraphQL**. 

I am always seeking opportunities to improve myself and further my knowledge in any way I can. My ability to accept and learn from constructive criticism has allowed me to thrive in a constantly changing environment, and I look forward to bringing that mentality into my future endeavors.
